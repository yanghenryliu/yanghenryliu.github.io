YANG LIU received a B.E. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Henan Polytechnic University and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) in 2018. He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from NC A&T in 2020 and 2024, respectively. He is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Information Systems at [North Carolina Central University (NCCU)](https://www.nccu.edu), where he also holds the title of Duke Power Endowed Professor at the School of Business. Additionally, He serves as the Associate Director of the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Equity Research (LAIER)](https://www.nccu.edu/slis/laboratory-artificial-intelligence-and-equity-research-laier).

His research focuses on understanding how individuals leverage online media to access information and support for health-related concerns. To this end, he develops and applies advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning models, and time series analysis to analyze digital data sources, including social media and search engine queries. His work facilitates the monitoring of online information-seeking behaviors, generating valuable insights to inform and improve public health resources and interventions.

His research interests include natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), social media mining, public health monitoring and pandemic surveillance. As an [IBM-HBCU Quantum Center](https://www.hbcuquantumcenter.org/) Faculty Fellow, he is exploring the potential applications of quantum computing and actively contributes to workforce development in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE). He has actively served on multiple IEEE conference program committees and has been a reviewer for over 20 journals and conferences.
