The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Research (IAIER) is a cutting-edge center for Artificial Intelligence (AI) education, research, and innovation. Through this institute, North Carolina Central University (NCCU) aims to foster a dynamic environment that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and leverages AI to address critical societal challenges. AI and data science have become transformative tools for real-time monitoring and predictive analytics across various domains, including public health, economics, and technology. This proposal presents the establishment of an undergraduate study and research group within the School of Business. The group will focus on AI and data science education, workforce development, computational methods in AI research, and the application of AI technologies for data analysis. By integrating AI methodologies with large-scale data analysis, this project seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and equip students with the skills necessary for careers in AI-driven analytics. Additionally, this initiative will play a vital role in workforce development by preparing students to meet the growing demand for AI and data science expertise across industries. This proposal outlines the development of an AI and data science education and research program at NCCU. This initiative aims to engage undergraduate students, ignite their interest in AI and data science, and establish sustainable teaching and research initiatives that will drive long-term innovation and academic excellence. By expanding research efforts at NCCU, we support the universityâ€™s goal of becoming a High Research Activity (R2) institution.
