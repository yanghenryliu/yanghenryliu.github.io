This course focuses on formal specification of programming languages, including definition of syntax and semantics: simple statements including precedence, infixes, prefix, and postfix notations. It highlights global properties of algorithmic languages including sequence control, data structure implementation, scooping, storage management, grouping of statements, binding time, sub-routines, and tasks.

Student Learning Objectives/Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to:

- Describe how programming language constructs are implemented from an abstract (high) level to the operating system and hardware (low)

- Implement portions of a compiler

- Select from the different language paradigms an appropriate programming language to design and implement an efficient and effective software application

- Write simple programs in different programming paradigms

- Understand how software interacts with the hardware
