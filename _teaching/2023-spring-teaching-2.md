This course teaches the Python programming language along with an environment and standards that encourage the efficient production of well-developed code. The course addresses numerical computing, data manipulation and analysis, plotting and visualization, machine learning, and language processing by focusing on the most important python libraries (e,g. Numpy, Matplotlib, ggplot2, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and NLTK) that enable the student to learn data science effectively using Python.

NOTE: The course involves hands-on coding, and it is necessary for every student to have access to a computer. The operating system on the computer does not really matter, however, we will use Mac operating system for the lectures. We will focus on Python 3 and use the IPython interactive development environment (IDE) or the Juypter Notebook.
