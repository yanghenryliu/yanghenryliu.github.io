This course provides an introduction to computer programming using the Java programming language. COMP 163 is primarily a programming course, but the focus is on the problem solving techniques common in computer science. No prior programming experience is assumed, although students should know the basics of using a computer (e.g., using a web browser and word processing program).

STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES / OUTCOMES (SLO)

Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to:
- Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the programâ€™s discipline.
- Use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary to create and debug a program.
- Read a Java program and understand what the program is doing.
